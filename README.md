# wordCount
These are basic word count example, on terminal and on intellij
  first we have to load the data and create RDD
  then if needed we can use float map to change strings in to words by using split inside the ourflatmap function
  I have used map function to add how many diistinct words that I have and count it inside the map function
  then the out put can be printed or saved 
  
  # Apache spark
